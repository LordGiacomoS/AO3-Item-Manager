`obfuscate.pyc` is a compiled python file due to the fact that if it were publicly readable, the de-obfuscation of logins would be doable by hand without the use of frequency analysis. As such, I am keeping this file compiled to make anyone trying to break my specific obfuscation actually work for it.

For anyone just trying to look at the code for educational purposes, an educational copy of the code used to generate the obfuscation key & encode and decode strings using said key is available under at <a href="https://github.com/LordGiacomoS/ASCII-Obfuscation-KeyValue-Generator">github.com/LordGiacomoS/ASCII-Obfuscation-KeyValue-Generator</a>, with a different set of values than the obfuscation key used here.
